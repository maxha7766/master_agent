## 🔐 Important Security Notes

### **✅ Secrets Management (SECURE)**
- Your API keys are in `.env` files (local only)
- `.env` is in `.gitignore` (won't be pushed to GitHub)
- `.env.example` documents required variables (no secrets)
- You'll add secrets to Railway/Vercel during deployment

### **⚠️ Before Pushing to GitHub:**
Run this command to verify no secrets will be pushed:
```bash
git status
```

Only these files should be staged:
- Source code (`.ts`, `.tsx` files)
- Configuration (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
- Documentation (`.md` files)
- `.env.example` (template only, no secrets)

**Should NOT see:**
- `.env` file
- Any files with API keys
